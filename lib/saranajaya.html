<p>
    The Regional Public Company (Perumda) Construction Sarana Jaya requires a development in its brand identity. In this project, we worked together to create a logo with several alternative colors that previously Sarana Jaya did not have, including the Element Design and their application to the promotional media they need such as Official Vehicles and Stationary for mailing. 
    <br><br>
    Design elements that made based on the shape of the Sarana Jaya logo itself with a similar meaning "infinity", which means means Sarana Jaya is a Perumda that carries out and supports sustainable development. In this New Fresh Look, it is hoped that Sarana Jaya Facilities can continue to be useful for sustainable development in the future.</p>
